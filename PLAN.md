# 🚗 ESP32 EFI Retrofit Project Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Convert a carburetor-equipped vehicle to electronic fuel injection (EFI) using an ESP32 microcontroller, retaining the carburetor as a simple throttle body.

---

## 🛠️ Project Steps

### 1. 📚 Research & Design
- Understand the vehicle's original carbureted fuel and ignition systems.
- Select compatible sensors (MAP, TPS, coolant temp, O2/lambda).
- Choose a suitable single injector and fuel pump.
- Design intake manifold modifications for injector mounting.

### 2. 🧑‍💻 ESP32 EFI Controller
- Set up ESP-IDF environment.
- Develop code to:
  - Read sensors (MAP, TPS, temperature, lambda).
  - Calculate required fuel pulse width using speed-density or Alpha-N algorithm.
  - Control injector via PWM.
  - Log data and provide serial debugging.
- (Optional) Prepare for ignition timing control.

### 3. 🛒 Parts Procurement
- Purchase ESP32 dev board, automotive sensors, injector, pump, pressure regulator, wiring, and connectors.

### 4. 🏗️ Mechanical Modifications
- Disable carburetor’s fuel circuits; retain only throttle function.
- Fabricate or modify intake manifold for injector fitment.
- Mount sensors (MAP to manifold, TPS to throttle shaft, lambda to exhaust).

### 5. ⚡ Fuel System
- Install high-pressure pump, filter, and regulator.
- Route fuel lines from tank to injector, with return.

### 6. 🧩 Electronics & Wiring
- Connect ESP32 to sensors and injector via relay/driver circuit.
- Power ESP32 and peripherals with automotive-grade supply.

### 7. 👨‍🔬 Software Setup & Calibration
- Flash firmware to ESP32.
- Calibrate sensors, set enrichment tables, and tune startup parameters.
- Test injector operation and validate sensor readings.

### 8. 🧪 Testing & Tuning
- Start engine, check for leaks and proper operation.
- Tune for cold start, idle, load, and acceleration.
- (Optional) Enable closed-loop lambda control for automatic mixture correction.

### 9. 📝 Documentation
- Write HOWTO guide.
- Publish code, instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
